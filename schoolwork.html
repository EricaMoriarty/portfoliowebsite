		<h2> 3D Modeling</h2>
		<p> In 3D Modeling we have done a lot of projects that have tought me a lot about how to model using computer software.
		We have done projects making a bookshelf, a lamp with animation, a bouncing ball with animation and squishing motion, a still life piece and for our final project we had to make a detailed room with 3 key objects like a articulated lamp, a chess piece and a screwdriver</p>
		</header>
	<p>here are the screenshots from my projects in 3Ds Max</p>
