	<p>Hello, my name is Erica Moriarty, I come from a rural town in County Kerry called Ballyheigue. My family owns a business locally called Moriarty’s Centra. I worked there for a few years while in secondary school. I finished secondary school and did my leaving cert in 2022. So, I decided to pursue a career in the gaming industry starting with a degree in computer games design. </p> 

 

	<p>I am a highly creative person. I work with digital software to make creative pieces such as digital illustrations. I am also a very curious person; I find it easy to learn and catch onto skills easily, for example when I worked with a carpenter, he would tell me to package a product in shrink wrap, he would show me how to do it and let me at it. I got to learn how to do it at my own pace and got it done a lot faster than I would if I had someone helping me. I have a huge interest in gaming, illustration, animation, music, and pop culture. As a result of working in retail for many years I have vast experience in customer support. I am also a hard worker and love working on things I enjoy. I also work better when I am given a specific task, shown how to do it, and then left to do it at my own pace. I am interested in the gaming industry because I would love to design aspects for games, especially story, fantasy or si-fi games, I would love to expand the industry and make my own games, characters, and their stories. I love to mess around and create characters in illustration and make stories for them. I have always had a vivid imagination and digital illustration and creative writing because it is an outlet for my imagination. I have always been interested in art since I was young, and I have filled so many sketchbooks with doodles and drawings. Art has been flowing through my family for generations, whether it be music, illustration, acting etc. I grew up surrounded by creativity which inspired me. I took art classes in and out of school getting some of the top grades in school. I hope to take these skills and show the world what I can do. </p>

 

	<p>I have a lot of goals for the future. As a creative person I have always wanted to share my stories, characters, and artistry in general. I think the gaming industry would be great for this. I can bring my characters to life through interactive games and sharing that with the world is my goal. I think because I really enjoy the creation of stories and characters and with that will work hard, I will succeed in reaching this goal.
 </p>
