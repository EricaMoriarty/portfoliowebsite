			<p> I have a lot of experience ouside of school that deals with design, video editin and photography. I have done freelance work for a theater group called 'Raged Road Theater' I was asked to change writing on their advetising signs. I have been drawing since i was young and designed characters, scenes, logos and tattoos. I create and edit my own videos for my own tiktok page. I take a lot of gaming screenshots for Instagram and discord for advertisment purposes like for fivem servers and developers. I also take a lot of photos of real life thinks like beaches and landscapes for fun.</p>
